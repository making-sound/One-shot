## What is One-shot?

A  minimalist one-shot sample player triggered by MIDI notes. It is a [Puredata (Pd)](http://www.puredata.info) patch so it will run on Mac, Windows and Linux. Useful for triggering a folder of sound effects from a MIDI keyboard, amongst other things. Includes safety features such as adjustable debounce and "all notes off".
