# One-shot

**Version 0.1. Still in development. Use at your own risk.**

A simple one-shot sample player triggered by a MIDI notes. It is a Puredata (Pd) patch so it will run on Mac, Windows and Linux. Useful for triggering a bunch of sound effects from a MIDI keyboard, amongst other things. Includes safety features such as adjustable debounce and new pitches only to prevent accidental double-triggering, and also all notes off/fade out.

One-shot also runs on a Raspberry Pi. More info coming soon.
