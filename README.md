# One-shot

A simple one-shot sample player triggered by MIDI notes. It is a [Puredata (Pd)](http://www.puredata.info) patch so it will run on Mac, Windows and Linux. Useful for triggering a bunch of sound effects from a MIDI keyboard, amongst other things. Includes safety features such as adjustable debounce and new pitches only to prevent accidental double-triggering, and also all notes off/fade out.
