# One-shot README

## What is One-shot?

A  minimalist one-shot sample player triggered by MIDI notes. It is a [Puredata (Pd)](http://www.puredata.info) patch so it will run on Mac, Windows and Linux. Useful for triggering a folder of sound effects from a MIDI keyboard, amongst other things. Includes safety features such as adjustable debounce and "all notes off".

For instructions, please visit the [One-shot project page](http://www.making-sound.co.uk/projects/one-shot.html).
